<h3>News</h3>
<p>Currently we have implemented a user api that will be used to generate pages.
The user will login, and the login will pass the user id to the api which will redirect the user to the
pages they are allowed to access</p>
<p>Flow: Login -> giftAppUrl/home (generates page based on user) </p>
<p><strong>end of week 16/02/2017</strong></p>
<p>Implemented login using cookies, server can now read users login state</p>
<p>Started implementing facebook login. Can now login with facebook, and server can access info. Need to upsert info, change cookie to logged in, then redirect to users homepage</p>
<p>Past updates</p>
<p>UPDATE: we are implementing a cookies session using npm module client-session. 
This will use a cookie to tell the server your are logged on, the cookie is encrypted.
It will have a 2 hour duration, increasing by 5 minutes by each user action</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE!</strong> User cookies are now implemented using a function to check session is valid.
The home page will still need to be rendered, and creation of the wishlist and item api/database will be needed
